# From Murdie and and Bhasin (2010): 
#
#    To create the new measures, we relied on the IDEA framework (Bond et al. 
#    2003). IDEA is a data set of all daily events in Reuters Global News 
#    Service. These data were organized in a "who" did "what" to "whom" manner
#    for each particular event, over 10 million events in the complete data set
#    (King and Lowe 2003).
#    
#    For our variables, we isolated events where... 
#    - a domestic group or individual is the "who," 
#    - the "what" is either violent or nonviolent protest, and 
#    - the "whom" is either a state agent or a state physical office. 
#    As mentioned earlier, violent protests are protests with the threat or use
#    of force. Attacking a government official or office, destroying government 
#    property, or a bombing of a government official's home are all examples of 
#    violent protest. Conversely, protest marches, demonstrations, boycotts, and
#    sit-ins are some of the many examples of nonviolent protest.[6] Our 
#    procedure identified over 50,000 violent and 20,000 nonviolent protest 
#    events from 1991 to 2004.
#    
#    [6] Tables of all the types of events included as protest and summary 
#    statistics are provided in the online replication materials.
#
# Their online replication materials (SI) are available in `data/raw/Murdie 
# Bhasin JCR Online Replication Materials 05.13.10.doc` and from 
# http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0022002710374715. The script 
# `R/01-create-murdie-bhasin-events.R` creates a the file 
# `data/murdie-bhasin-events.csv` that contains these events.

# load events that murdie and bhasin classify as protest events

## I had a hard time with the sectors, but I found this helpful on the Wayback machine.

## I captured the relevant webpages as pdfs in `data/raw/wayback-sector-hierarchy.pdf` and
## `data/raw/wayback-sector-descriptions.pdf`. I'm including sectors listed under
## "government agents," which *I hope* includes a "state physical office" (??). See the file
